        <h1 class="title">Hello, I'm Joshua Brown</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">About</h1>
        <p>I am passionate about all things technology and a firm believer in the good computers can do for humanity.
            From game development in C# to data manipulation in Python, I'm devoted to learning about new ways to use technology.
            This website serves as a catalogue of the projects I have been working on, big and small, and as a record of the new things I learn and places I go.</p>

        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>This wbesite was created not only as a way to catologue my journey though computer science, but also as a fun way to practice web development. I have experimented with web develeopment before in the past, such as making small games and a calculator website, but this website is my first attempt at a truly <i>good</i> website.</p>
        <h2>ASCII Renderer</h2>
        <p>One concept I find extremely captivating is that of creative restraint, meaning that restraints placed upon someone that relate to a creative project lead said someone to express more creativity in their completion of the project. This, fundamentally, is what led to ASCII Renderer: my attempt at creating a rendering engine in the command line using Python. "Engine" is used in a light sense here, the system is nowhere near as fully-fledged as more modern complex systems,</p>
