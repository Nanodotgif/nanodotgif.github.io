      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I am passionate about all things technology and a firm believer in the
        good computers can do for us. From game development in C# to data
        manipulation in Python, I'm devoted to learning about creative and
        innovative new ways to use technology. This website serves as a
        catalogue of the projects I have been working on, big and small, and as
        a record of the new things I learn.

      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/nanodotgif/nanodotgif.github.io"
          >This website</a
        >
        was created not only as a way to catalogue my journey though computer
        science, but also as a fun way to practice web development. I have
        experimented with web development before in the past, such as making
        small games and a calculator website, but this website is my first
        attempt at a truly <i>good</i> website.

      <h2>ASCII Renderer</h2>
      <p>
        One concept I find extremely captivating is that of creative restraint,
        meaning that restraints placed upon someone that relate to a creative
        project lead said someone to express more creativity in their completion
        of the project. This, fundamentally, is what led to
        <a href="https://github.com/Nanodotgif/ASCII-Renderer">ASCII Renderer</a
        >: my attempt at creating a rendering engine in the command line using
        Python. "Engine" is used in a light sense here, the system is only
        capable of displaying simple images made of text characters, indicative
        of "ASCII art". To test the renderer, I made a game of Pong which runs
        in the command prompt.
      </p>

        <img src="/images/pong-ascii.png" />
        <p>An example project using the Renderer: Pong in the terminal!</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Time Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        The time calculator stemmed from my desire to create something that is
        useful and polished, more of a product than a project. It isn't perfect,
        but it helped me practice the complete execution of creating a
        purpose-built product, from design to deployment. You can find the
        finished project
        <a href="https://nanodotgif.github.io/time-calculator">here</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="img-caption">
        <img src="/images/time-calculator.png" />
        <p>
          The interface for the Time Calculator. I experimented with scrolling
          controls on mobile and PC to allow the user to scroll over the times
          to raise and lower them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Gridline Skies</h2>
      <p>
        Gridline Skies was my first attempt at creating a basic video game with
        the Unity Engine. Though it hasn't been fully completed, the game did
        make it to a playable beta state. Making games with Unity has been a
        great motivator for me to learn more about C# and programming in general
        with the benefit of a result I can be proud of. I learned about Unity's
        3D Rigidbody physics system and the general layout of interactive
        experiences from the main menu to the settings to the sounds. Game
        development as a hobby has allowed me to interactively exercise making
        highly scalable and efficient code, as many complex game systems need to
        run many times per second.
      </p>
      <div class="img-caption">
        <img src="/images/gridline-skies-editor.png" />
        <p>
          Gridline Skies was a grappling hook game inspired by
          <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-handulum">Handulum</a>.

      <h2>VEX U Robot</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the Auburn University Robotics club, I work with a team to
        design, build, program, and document a robot to compete in the 2025
        <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vrc-current-game"
          >Vex Robotics V5 U competition</a
        >.This has given me the opportunity to practice working in a
        multi-disciplined team and to create code that performs real tangible
        functions in a competition setting. The process has involved rigorous
        documentation (in the form of an engineering notebook) and prototyping
        to create a final product that is not only effective and efficient, but
        well-documented and created with care.
